## [aka 'TactileScopeMatrixCity'©®]

Yet another Lego grid scanner but *google* times better than yours. 

#### Running 

clone and run from any modern browser. Yes, IE7 on Windows XP might not work.

#### Setup

Table and LEGO bricks settings are under `data` folder in `json` format. This could be brought into GUI at later stage. 
To create or test binary permutations, us this: `/Py_BinaryPermutations/py_bin.py`

#### features
- web-based, HTML5 + JS without dependencies 
- 100x100 VOXELS scanning + cityIO upload without lag [well, might have *some* lag running it from your phone]
- ~600k potential permutations ['types'] using only black and white optically tagged objects 

#### the real important features
- 80's graphics
- Turing Complete
- Turing Prize Winner

#### the story behind CityScopeJS
CityScopeJS, popularly known as 'TactileScopeMatrixCity'©® was invented during a warm, steamy but somehow cold summer night in December, 2013. My friend [Hackerman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU) and I were riding [Jeremiah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBlWkNZph0s), our old faithful Trojan horse, across the Mohave dessert.

Since we were both holding on to Jeremiah's saddle, Hackerman was only able to write the code in 0.5 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Title"), using his [Nintendo PowerGlove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove); After 6 hours of code-riding, TactileScopeMatrixCity©® was developed, tested, QAed by NASA and SpaceX and ready to [disrupt and make the world a better place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps)

The system has since won the Oscars, Turing Prize, 47 pending patents, a book and was featured in nine Bollywood films.
