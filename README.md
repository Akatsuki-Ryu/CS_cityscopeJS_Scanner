### The true story behind CityScopeJS

CityScopeJS, also favorably known as _©® TactileScopeMatrixCityLEGOtizer ©®_ was invented during a warm, steamy but somehow cold summer night in December, 2013. My friend [Hackerman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU) and I were riding [Jeremiah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBlWkNZph0s), our old faithful Trojan horse, across the Mohave dessert.

Since we were both holding on to Jeremiah's saddle, Hackerman was only able to write the code in 0.5 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Title"), using his [Nintendo PowerGlove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove); After 6 hours of code-riding, CityScopeJS was developed, tested, QAed by NASA and SpaceX and was ready to [disrupt and make the world a better place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps)

The system has since won the Oscars, Turing Prize, 47 pending patents, a book and was featured in nine Bollywood films.
